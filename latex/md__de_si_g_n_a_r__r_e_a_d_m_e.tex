This is the beginning of a complete project which is expected to be a general library to make different kinds of models and simulation.

The structure of this library is\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item include directory\+: Contains all the header files.
\item src directory\+: Contains all the source files (implementations declared in headers.
\item samples directory\+: Contains some test and demos with the usage of the differents developed abstractions.
\item obj directory\+: In this directory will be created all the objects files when you compile the library.
\item lib directory\+: When you compile the library, in this directory will be added the file lib\+Designar.\+a.
\item bin directory\+: When you compile the samples, in this directory will be added the binary files to execute.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In order to compile the library you must execute \char`\"{}make library\char`\"{}.

In order to compile the samples you must execute \char`\"{}make samples\char`\"{}.

T\+O\+DO\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tarjan Algorithm for computing strong connected components to Digraph.
\item Making all the documentation.
\item Making test for Graph and Digraph. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
