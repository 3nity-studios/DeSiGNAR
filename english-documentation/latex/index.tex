This is the beginning of a complete project which is expected to be a general library to make different kinds of models and simulation.

The structure of this library is\+:

\tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu} spread 0pt [c]{*{2}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\PBS\centering \textbf{ Directory }&\textbf{ Description  }\\\cline{1-2}
\endfirsthead
\hline
\endfoot
\hline
\rowcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\PBS\centering \textbf{ Directory }&\textbf{ Description  }\\\cline{1-2}
\endhead
\PBS\centering {\itshape include} &Contains all the header files. \\\cline{1-2}
\PBS\centering {\itshape src} &Contains all the source files (implementations declared in headers. \\\cline{1-2}
\PBS\centering {\itshape samples} &Contains some test and demos with the usage of the differents developed abstractions. \\\cline{1-2}
\PBS\centering {\itshape obj} &In this directory will be created all the objects files when you compile the library. \\\cline{1-2}
\PBS\centering {\itshape lib} &When you compile the library, in this directory will be added the file {\bfseries lib\+Designar.\+a.} \\\cline{1-2}
\PBS\centering {\itshape bin} &When you compile the samples, in this directory will be added the binary files to execute. \\\cline{1-2}
\end{longtabu}
In order to compile the library you must execute


\begin{DoxyCode}
~$ make library
\end{DoxyCode}
 In order to compile the samples you must execute


\begin{DoxyCode}
~$ make samples
\end{DoxyCode}
